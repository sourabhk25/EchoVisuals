## Workflow overview

### Frontend (React with TailwindCSS): 
The user interacts with the React frontend, which is styled using TailwindCSS. When a user submits a prompt for image generation, the frontend sends this request to the backend.

### Backend (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB): 
The backend receives the request and processes it. It involves communication with the MongoDB database for user authentication, storing prompts. For image generation, it communicates with OpenAI's DALL-E model.

### OpenAI's DALL-E & Cloudinary Integration: 
The backend uses OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate images based on the prompts. Once the images are generated, they are uploaded to Cloudinary for storage, optimization, and delivery. This reduces load times and improves availability.

### Database (MongoDB): 
The application uses database for persisting user data, prompts, and metadata about generated images and their storage in Cloudinary.
